Edward Birdsall
Letchworth, Hertfordshire (London) UK. (October 2023)
I am the Lead Software Engineer and Architect (Quant Developer) with a Cambridge based Hedge Fund. I have
built, and contributed significantly to the design of, an automated Order Management System (OMS). This is the
core piece of infrastructure which converts alpha signals into real-world orders, manages and dispatches them
to exchanges, and handles reconciliation when FIX trade reports are returned to the Firm.
In 2021 I finished an measurement of the decay rate of a rare nuclear decay isotope as part of my PhD. This was a
complex analysis to measure a weak signal in data containing high levels of noise. In addition to the nuclear
halflife, I was able to make the worlds first measurement of a parameter characterizing the spectral shape of the
decay energy distribution. The precision of this parameter was good enough to give an indication as to which
underlying physics theory was responsible for the decay. (Model validation.)
My analysis combined multiple sources and distributions of data with independent measurements of background
rates. I worked extensively on the development of models for systematic effects. My final model contained over
40 parameters. I developed 2 methods of performing the measurement, and developed a deep understanding of
the statistical and numerical non-linear fitting methods required to perform the analysis while doing so.
My background combines two areas of strength. Firstly I have exposure to rigorous data analysis and research
from my PhD in Experimental Particle Physics. Secondly, I have subsequently expanded my skills into the world
of professional Software Engineering. I have a reputation for being highly creative, and producing reliable,
flexible, Software Systems and Architecture.
I am searching for an intellectually stimulating and interesting role within the Financial Services industry. I am
interested in data, and I want to work on projects searching for Alpha with the ambition of beating everyone else
in the market. I believe I would be most effective within a small research team. I am capable of programming in
Python, and have used the language recently in personal projects.
# Research Experience & Education
The University of Manchester 2016 2021
PhD, Experimental Particle Physics Manchester, UK
I performed the world first measurement of the Axial-Vector coupling constant in a rare nuclear decay process,
and performed the best measurement of the decay rate using experimental data in the presence of noise.
I built an extensive software framework to support the analysis. This included a domain specific language (DSL)
and a basic interpreter. I created the DSL to control and drive the entire analysis procedure, and to make the
analysis flexible and programmable without having to change the underlying C++ code. Instead, multiple DSL
specifications could be maintained in version control for specific measurements.
 Worlds first measurement of a parameter characterizing the spectral shape of the decay energy distribution in a rare
isotope decay. Worlds most sophisticated measurement of the halflife.
 Development of multi-parameter statistical model containing over 40 parameters. Performed multi-parameter
measurement of model parameters with complex dataset with small signal to noise ratio, using non-linear numerical
optimization.

Quantitative Developer, Lead Software Engineer, Systems Architect Cambridge, UK
Grantabridge Research is a startup Hedge Fund with an alpha strategy trading FX and Commodities Futures.
Grantabridge have a business-to-business contract with Exodus Point, who provide execution and
infrastructure support. I perform multiple roles within Grantabridge. I am a technical expert and technology
consultant, the Lead Software Engineer, Software Architect, and Quantitative Developer.
I provide technical expertise in a range of technologies, capabilities to design and build flexible and robust
software systems, and the mathematical background necessary to implement quantitative systems. The
primary technologies we use include Rust and Kafka.
 Contributed significantly to the high-level "Whiteboard" Systems Design. Resolved design problems on paper before
writing a line of code.
 Designed and built Kafka libraries to provide a uniform framework data-exchange layer, and to support multiple
datatypes per topic. Extended the functionality to allow message types to be returned directly to client code,
dramatically increasing team productivity.
 Implemented automated test benches including a design for a "fake" Kafka cluster for system-wide integration testing.
 Designed and built multiple key infrastructure components, including VAR (Value At Risk) Engine, Exchange Trading
Hours system to prevent trading during low-liquidity periods, reconciliation components, and fast Rolling-Median
algorithms.
