edward birdsall letchworth hertfordshire london uk october i am the lead software engineer and architect quant developer with a cambridge based hedge fund i have built and contributed significantly to the design of an automated order management system oms this is the core piece of infrastructure which converts alpha signals into realworld orders manages and dispatches them to exchanges and handles reconciliation when fix trade reports are returned to the firm in i finished an measurement of the decay rate of a rare nuclear decay isotope as part of my phd this was a complex analysis to measure a weak signal in data containing high levels of noise in addition to the nuclear halflife i was able to make the worlds first measurement of a parameter characterizing the spectral shape of the decay energy distribution the precision of this parameter was good enough to give an indication as to which underlying physics theory was responsible for the decay model validation my analysis combined multiple sources and distributions of data with independent measurements of background rates i worked extensively on the development of models for systematic effects my final model contained over parameters i developed methods of performing the measurement and developed a deep understanding of the statistical and numerical nonlinear fitting methods required to perform the analysis while doing so my background combines two areas of strength firstly i have exposure to rigorous data analysis and research from my phd in experimental particle physics secondly i have subsequently expanded my skills into the world of professional software engineering i have a reputation for being highly creative and producing reliable flexible software systems and architecture i am searching for an intellectually stimulating and interesting role within the financial services industry i am interested in data and i want to work on projects searching for alpha with the ambition of beating everyone else in the market i believe i would be most effective within a small research team i am capable of programming in python and have used the language recently in personal projects research experience education the university of manchester phd experimental particle physics manchester uk i performed the world first measurement of the axialvector coupling constant in a rare nuclear decay process and performed the best measurement of the decay rate using experimental data in the presence of noise i built an extensive software framework to support the analysis this included a domain specific language dsl and a basic interpreter i created the dsl to control and drive the entire analysis procedure and to make the analysis flexible and programmable without having to change the underlying code instead multiple dsl specifications could be maintained in version control for specific measurements worlds first measurement of a parameter characterizing the spectral shape of the decay energy distribution in a rare isotope decay worlds most sophisticated measurement of the halflife development of multiparameter statistical model containing over parameters performed multiparameter measurement of model parameters with complex dataset with small signal to noise ratio using nonlinear numerical optimization development of models to characterize systematics integration of systematic penalty parameters into numerical modelling extensive statistical sensitivity measurements and measurements of confidence levels sensitivity studies to predict performance of future experiments using montecarlo mc simulation algorithm optimization and development for processing of large datasets performed analysis of timestamps from track detector hardware measured correlations in data and implemented a realistic model as a shared library plugin to improve results produced by montecarlo detector simulation experience producing publication quality figures graphics and research
